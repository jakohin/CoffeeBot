# CoffeeBot
This is a simple Vue-Frontend paired with an FastAPI backend.
The future use case is to dispatch a robot that'll make and bring you a coffee.

Communication between the API & the robot happens via MQTT.
For further and more complicated implementations within the backend api, the robot must first be brought to live; which hasn't happend (yet).
